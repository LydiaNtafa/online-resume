  description: |
    My journey began with my passion for software development which I followed by successfully completing my BSc in Computer Science. Through this, I have had wide experience across multiple industries such as data analytics, education, and game development.
     I am driven by curiosity and seeking ways to make improvements where feasible. I live and work in London since 2017. During this time, I’ve climbed through the ranks, starting in Customer Service and ultimately reaching the position of eCommerce Manager. 
     It was during my last role, where I was heavily involved in optimising the company's consumer-facing websites that my passion for building effective and accessible software got reignited and drove me towards another life-changing decision.
     I wanted to refresh my coding skills and gain professional insight into the latest technologies and procedures of the modern tech industry. This is why I completed an intensive coding boot camp where I learned to apply test-driven development and agile methodologies while designing and building projects as part of a team.
    I am passionate about working within an inspiring organisation where I can utilise my problem-solving skills to make a visible change for others. I seek to further upgrade my software development skills, tackle complex coding challenges and embark on a journey of continuous learning in this ever-evolving field.

    A reference section in a resume is a list of individuals who can vouch for your skills, work ethic, and character. These individuals are typically former managers, colleagues, or mentors who have worked closely with you in the past and can provide insight into your abilities and work style.

    It's important to note that including a reference section in a resume is not always necessary, and some employers may prefer to request references separately. If you do choose to include a reference section, it should typically be located at the end of your resume.

    When listing references, be sure to include the individual's name, job title, company name, phone number, and email address. It's also a good idea to ask for the individual's permission before listing them as a reference, and to let them know what kind of job you are applying for so they can speak to your relevant skills and experience.

    It's important to choose references who can provide a positive and comprehensive evaluation of your work. Avoid listing family members or friends as references, and instead focus on individuals who can speak to your professional abilities and accomplishments.
